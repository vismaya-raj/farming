FarmSite connects farmers directly with consumers, eliminating the need for middlemen and ensuring fair prices for both parties. Farmers can list their products on the platform, including fruits, vegetables, homemade preserves, and other homegrown items. Users can browse through the available products, view details, and place orders for delivery or pickup.
